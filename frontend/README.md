# Broth & Ladle ðŸ¥•

Welcome to the Broth & Ladle - Soup Recipes App! This is a React-based web application that allows you to browse and search a collection of soup recipes.

## Technologies used

This project was built with:

- TypeScript
- React & React Router
- Ð¡SS modules
- JSON server

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application and the JSON server by running:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will start both the React application and the JSON server at the same time. The React application will be served at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the JSON server will be served at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start browsing soup recipes. You can use the search bar to find specific recipes by name or ingredient, or you can browse the list of all recipes. Click on a recipe to see its details, including a list of ingredients and instructions for making the soup. If you want to leave a comment or add a new soup, you need to register using the fake registration form on the site (the data will be stored on your computer).
